A Narcissistic Number (or Armstrong Number) is a positive number which is the sum of its own digits, 
each raised to the power of the number of digits in a given base. In this Kata, 
we will restrict ourselves to decimal (base 10).

function narcissistic(int $value): bool {
  // Your code here
  $array = str_split($value);
  $len = count($array);
  $sum = 0;
  
  foreach($array as $n){
    $sum += pow((int)$n,$len);
  }
  return $sum == $value;
}
